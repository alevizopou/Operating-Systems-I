# Operating-Systems-I
This repository contains the two assignments of the course Operating Systems Î™. Unfortunately, there is no assignment document available, but, on the other hand, almost every line of code has a comment (in Greek), so maybe this will help a little.

- `Assignment #1`:
For this assignment we had to implement a server-client model for the operation and management of a pizzeria, using forks, shared memory, sockets, semaphores and signals.

- `Assignment #2`:
For this assignment we had to implement the same server-client model as above, but this time we had to use threads instead of forks.
